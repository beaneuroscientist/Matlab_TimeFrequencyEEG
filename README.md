# Matlab_TimeFrequencyEEG
Tools for Time Frequency Analysis on EEG
This package provides custom matlab scripts for time-frequency and related analyses in EEG data.  This software does have a strong dependency on EEGLAB for some basic functions to work.  If EEGlab is not in the path this software will throw errors when it is checking the input of the functions provided.   Additonally these functions look for an EEGLAB data structure to compute the analysis on. Information regarding EEGLAB and their  software can be found at their website: https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/index.php
